# EverdeckLibrary
The Everdeck is a card game system jam packed with card information patterns usable across various traditional and modern games. This is a web app archives a variety of games playable with the Everdeck.

## An Alternative Archiving Solution
The Everdeck Library is an alternative archiving option for games playable by the Everdeck.
Most of the Everdeck‚Äôs game lists are available on online forums such as BGG and Reddit. The Everdeck Library takes the format of those game lists and expands upon them by providing in-depth information and interactivity from being able to filter out certain games to knowing how the Everdeck maps to the game‚Äôs cards and rules.
Sifting through the Everdeck‚Äôs 120 cards for the game you‚Äôre playing is quite involved and forgetting a card or not knowing what a card does can heavily hinder gameplay experience.

## Quick Start
You can access the web app through its Vercel deployment at [https://everdeck-library.vercel.app/](https://everdeck-library.vercel.app/)

To setup a local version of the Everdeck Library, you'll need to do the following:
- Clone (or download and extract) this project and open a command line in its directory 
- Install the necessary dependencies with `npm install` or something similar
- You'll need to link a MongoDB database to the web app for it to function
  - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add this line `MONGODB_URI="MongoDB connection string"`
  - The MongoDB database requires a specific format to function. See the **DB Structure** section for more details
- Run the project with `npm run dev`

## DB Structure
This web app uses MongoDB with the following Collections:
### Game
- _id: ObjectID
  - Unique entry ID
  - Used in the **Rules** and **CardZone** Collections
- title: string
- cardImg: string
  - A link to the game's box art
  - For the Vercel deployment, this uses the `<thumbnail>` element from the **BGG XML API**
- shDescription: string
  - Short description of the game
- plCount: Object
  ```
  plCountMin: int
  plCountMax: int
  ```
  - Setting both fields to the same value results in 1 value shown
- plTime: Object
  ```
  plTimeMin: int
  plTimeMax: int
  ```
  - Setting both fields to the same value results in 1 value shown
- complexity: double
- gameType: [string]
  ```
  Abstract, Customizable, Family, Thematic, Children, Party, Strategy, Wargames
  ```
  - The game's player count, play time, weight, and game type as described on BGG
- mapStrength: string
  - How well does the Everdeck map/emulate the game
  ```
  Perfect - Maps 1:1
  High - Playable with a few changes, mental tracking, or a simple card guide
  Low - Playable but with missing feature, changes with fair amounts of mental tracking, or complex card guides
  ```
- extComponents: [string]
  - Any extra components the game needs that's not related to tracking score (unless score affects gameplay)

- _id: ObjectID
  - Unique entry ID
- game_id: ObjectID
  - Game ID assigned to the Rules entry
- summary: string
- bggLink: string
  - The URL link to the game's BGG entry
- rules: [object]
  ```
  objective - string
  setup - string
  gameplay - string
  ruleSource - string
  *mapDiff - string (Use only on non-perfect mapping strength)
  ```
  - Special formatting: 
    - newline (enter) - Newlines don‚Äôt need the `\n` escape character
    - Tab - Use the `\t` escape character
- cardTable: [object]
  ```
  rank: string
  suit: string
  label: string
  cardZone: [ObjectID]
  ```
  - A table cell can be assigned to multiple card zones
- extComponents: [string]
  - A list of extra components

### CardZones
- _id: ObjectID
  - Unique entry ID
- game_id: ObjectID
  - Game ID assigned to the CardZones entry
- keyword: string
  - Keywords assigned to the card zone. Used in the **Rules** Collections
    - Case insensitive
    - The longest variant of a keyword must be first `Ex: royal cards, royal card, royal`
